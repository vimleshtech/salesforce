Salesforce to Salesforce Data Migration

Client:
Consulting Service 
Industry:
Healthcare 
Technologies: 
Apex, Visualforce, Apex Data Loader, Salesfroce to Salesforce(S2S) 
The project was to migrate data from one salesforce instance to another using a tool, such as Apex Data Loader and natively supported feature of the force.com platform namely salesforce to salesforce(S2S). We migrated standard objects such as Account, Contact, Opportunity, Case, Case Comment, Lead, Solutions, Attachments, Task, Event, TaskRelation, EventRelation, Campaign, CampaignMember, OpportunityProduct, Schedule, Document etc. using Apex Data Loader as we wanted to keep system audit fields such as created by, created date, lastmodified by and last modified date same both in source and target orgatization. For this we had to raise a case with salesforce support to enable audit fields before migration.

We executed the following steps to migrate standard objects using Data Loader.
1. Defined a formula field in the source org in each of the objects we migrated to hold the record id of the obejct. This was to match the records in source as well as in the target org.
2. Extracted data from the source salesforce org.
3. Replaced the old master as well as lookup values with new values using VLOOKUP function in Microsoft Excel.
4. Created  custom  fields in the target org in each of the objects to hold the old record ids i.e. the record id of the source org.
5. Uploaded the data to the target salesforce org using Data Loader.

We also migrated many custom objects using S2S feature of force.com. For this we executed the following steps:
1. Enabled salesforce to salesforce in source as well as target org.
2. Established a connection between source and target org by sending an invitation from source  to target org before data migration.
2. After the connection was established, in the source org we published the objects we wanted to migrate.
3. In the target org we subscribed the objects and mapped the fields in target org with those of source org.
4. Implemeted scripts using apex to set the master as well as lookup values in the obejcts.
5. Desgined a visualforce page with a dropdown to popuate custom objects and a button next to it to start migration after selecting the object.
6. In the same visualforce page we also designed buttons to execute the apex script to set the master as well as lookup values in the objects.

During entire process of data migration we disabled all the workflow rules, triggers and validation rules to avoid failure in data migration, due to validation errors.

Customization in Salesforce

In Salesforce, standard feature for every Quote, there is an option to get quote PDF. PDF contains some existing and standard fields of Quote. In this project quote template modification has been done. New quote template contains not only fields from quote, as well as fields from quote line items. Some of those fields are existing and some are calculated/modified. In template Terms and Conditions text is also modified as per requirement. 

Sort feature in Salesforce for Opportunity Line items does not give flexibility to sort line items level wise. Also it does not provide option to override the sort feature. In customization projects new Sort feature has been developed. It is a completely a new addition. This feature has level wise sort facility. Say, there are 10 line items. First user can sort based on Quantity of those, then based on Price and so on. Flexibility given is upto 4 levels. Click on new Sort button gives sorting option and save line items. New sorted line items will be shown in a new related list in Opportunity detail page. 

New fields which are mainly calculated field based on lots of data and information at various table are added. Those fields are mainly populated via trigger. All these acts on Opportunity, Contact, Quote, Lead etc. 

Overriding existing related list has been done. Standard related list often does not serve purpose of displaying required field and specifically calculated fields needed for business purpose. Overriding existing list gives chance to display required format and fields of related list. 

Lead convert is an existing feature of Salesforce. It has some floe of actions automatically performed while a Lead is converted to contact or account. Customization of Lead convert via trigger fired just after lead is converted provides additional features needed like Create 2 extra contacts from Parent information of converted Lead etc. 

Building Settings such as Visualforce page for existing application in organization. This provides one stop facility to organization administrator to set up global variables. Creating formula fields, Roll up fields for database. Trigger for Email firing at a specific interval based on requirements. Sync feature of Salesforce in customized, modified and deployed to various accounts.

The project has the requirement is to create custom reports (not the standard Salesforce reports) with all kinds of filter options for the customer portal users to input based on different fields. The reports will contain custom grouping (summary/sub-summary), sorting, limiting etc.

The requirement was to use custom Visualforce pages and apex controllers for the reports to generate the reports with all the user input and system configuration validations.

Filters: System administrator to enter the validations in the report configuration page (different from the Report Page) according to which data will be displayed at the start up when a customer portal user clicks on the report link. User also has the option to override the configuration done by the system administrator.

Grouping: The report data needed to be grouped accordingly as per requirement. We have created custom grouping/subgrouping for the report data and displayed in the Visualforce page.

Sorting: The report data was sorted in ascending/descending order as per the requirement

Export: We have created the export functionality as csv/excel where users can export the whole report data in a csv or excel file with the required field's data and used them likewise.
