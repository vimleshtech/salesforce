Today's Topics
============================
-Picklist
-Lookup vs masterloop
-Rollup Summary   : is aggregiate function in parent object
			-sum(), count(), max() , min()
-Formula	: calculation and computation 	

-Data Type

-Constraints 

-Validation Rule 

-Record Type 		: one page/tab multiple view (seperate view for every user)


Picklist : is collection values/items which is resuable on webpage/tab
=============
-> Country
-> Gender
-> Category b

There are following way to create picklist:
	i. Create/Add new field and choose type picklist and add list of values
	ii. Global picklist 
		->Setup -> Create -> Picklist value set 
	


Note : pick list can be single or multiple selection 




Lookup vs master lookup
===========================
Lookup : one object is dependent on different object
 	- there is no impact on child object if parent object will be removed/deleted
	- We cannot view all child information from parent object
	
MasterLookup : is also kind of lookup 
		-we can track and manage child object information from parent object
		-all child rows will be removed if parent is removed 
	
 

Objects:
	ClassRoom - Demo
		name    #no of seats    availability   occupied 
		Room1 	100 		98		2	
		Room2	30
		
	Student - Demo 
			name			classroom 	dob   standard
			Student1		Room1
			Student2		Room1
			Student3		Room2
	
	


  Step1 :
		create parent object
		and add field
		   #of of seats 

  Step 2: 
		 create child object
		 Then add masterlookup from parent object (classroom-demo)
		 add other fields
			-dob
			-standard
			..
 Step 3:
			
	Add rollup summary on parent object (rollup is allowed only if parent 		object is reffered as masterlookup in other child object)
 

	There are following inbuilt aggregiate functions:
		-count()
		-sum()
		-max()
		-min()

					
Data Type
=====================
-Auto Number** : system will generate the no. automatically for every column'
-Formula    ** : any maths, text, date function and expression can be applied here 
-Rollup Summary **
-Lookup Relationship**
-Lookup Maser Relationship **
-External Lookup 
-Checkbox 		: checked , unchecked 
-Picklist  **
-Picklist (multi select)  **
-Text vs TextLong , and RichText
	

Constraints  : is rules and regulation /condition
===================================================
-> Required Field
-> No Duplicate
-> Data type and Size

Validation Rule  : custom validation 
================================
Go to object -> Then create new rule /edit existing rule 

Record Type 
===================
Go to Object -> add record type

We must have at least two page layout
